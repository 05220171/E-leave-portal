            <p>The JNEC E-Leave Portal was developed in 2025 by two students of Jigme Namgyel Engineering college, pursuing their diploma in computer system and network in final year. They are passionate about crafting student-focused digital platforms that streamline processes and create positive experiences.</p>
            <p> Driven by a desire to apply their technical skills to solve a real-world challenge within their own college community, they undertook the development of this E-Leave system. Their vision was to create a centralized, accessible platform that reduces administrative overhead and provides a clear, reliable way for students and staffs to manage their leave requirements.Rinchen and Karma hope this website proves valuable to the JNEC community.</p>
